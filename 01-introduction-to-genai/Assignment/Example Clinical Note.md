	Session Duration: 50 minutes
	Patient Name: Jane Smith 
	Patient Number: XXXXXX
**Subjective:**
	Miss Smith reports continued feelings of depression. She describes her symptoms as having worsened, saying “I find it hard to get out of bed every day”. She is disinterested in her work and no longer enjoys her hobbies, saying she “doesn’t see the point”. Miss Smith also reports feeling symptoms of anxiety and struggles to socialize with friends and family. 
**Objective:**
	Miss Smith had slow verbal responses during the session. She found it difficult to maintain a conversation and her speech had a flat affect. Her compliance with medication is good, but there are no evident improvements. Eating patterns are irregular but weight remains unchanged. She reported having difficulty falling and staying asleep. 
**Assessment:**
	Miss Smith presents as unfocused and disinterested. Her participation was reduced since her last session, and she struggled to maintain conversation and appropriately respond to questions and prompts. Although Miss Smith is compliant with medication, it has not had an observable effect. Suicidal ideas or intentions were not expressed and do not appear present. 
**Plan:**
	Miss Smith is undergoing CBT to alleviate depressive symptoms. Medication will remain unchanged for the next 14 days. If no progress is observed, Miss Smith will be referred to a psychiatrist. Miss Smith will continue to attend weekly therapy sessions. She has been instructed to practice replacing negative self-talk with positive self-talk and has set a goal to go for two walks in between sessions.
