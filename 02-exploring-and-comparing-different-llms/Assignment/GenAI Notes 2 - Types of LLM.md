# Exploring and comparing different LLM types

Foundation Models 
- are trained using unsupervised data, thus do not require labeling, and need very large models with billions of parameters
- can be reused to make more specialized models
LLM
- subset of Foundation Model, for language


## Types of Foundation Models

### [[Embeddings]]

### [[Image Generation]]

### [[Text Based]]

## Tiers of LLM (cheap and ineffective to expensive and effective)
### Prompt engineering with context

### Retrieval augmented generation

### Fine tuned model

### New trained model
